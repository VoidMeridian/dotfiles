I super do not recommend using these dotfiles  
however if you're dead set on it then take note  
- bin/ contains a bunch of scripts that either I wrote or I found on github, the ones I wrote are poorly written and entirely undocumented, as for the github scripts, they're github scripts
- fonts/ contain a custom version of the Nerd Fonts CaskaydiaCove Mono font, its been merged with as many other Nerd Fonts as I could find in order to provide as many glyphs as possible
- - its also got ligatures enabled
- .config/ contains all the configs for the various apps I use
- just about anything that could be themed uses Catppuccin Mocha
